QScript is a Simple Scripting Language, written in the D Programming Language.

It utilises a compiler to generate byte code which is then executed in a
Virtual Machine.

The goal is to be fast enough while also being simple and fun to write and read.
Currently, it is being re-written under a redesigned spec.

The new spec includes:

* modules
* public / private module members
* first class functions
* lambda functions
* reference data types
* compile time function execution
* conditional compilation
* metaprogramming
