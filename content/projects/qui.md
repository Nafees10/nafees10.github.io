QUI is a Text User Interface library for the D Programming Language. It aims to
provide a minimalistic set of interfaces to enable creation of widgets easily.

It is built using Adam D. Ruppe's terminal.d module, making it cross platform.

Some of it's key features:

* Object Oriented
* Mouse events
* Scrolling - nested scrolling too
* "FPS" limiting
* Need based rendering
