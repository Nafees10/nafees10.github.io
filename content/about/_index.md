Hi, I'm Nafees.

I started computer programming around the time I was 9-10 years oldin 2009. The
first languages I learnt were GameMaker Language, Lua, PHP, and Delphi. Around
this time I started some projects, some of which have evolved considerably.

Currently I am a pursing BS(Software Engineering) at FAST NUCES Lahore, since
2021.

Here is my resume: [resume.pdf](/resume.pdf)
